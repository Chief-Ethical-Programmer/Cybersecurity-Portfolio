# DVWA Setup
- This project documents how I set up the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) in my local pentesting lab.
- DVWA is a purposely insecure web application created by the community at DVWA on GitHub.
-  Itâ€™s designed to help learners like me practice and understand real-world web vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Command Injection, File Upload flaws, and many more.
- The setup is simple to create, safe and in a controlled environment where I can experiment, break things, and learn how web attacks actually work, without risking any real systems.
- This project walks through the process of running DVWA locally using Docker containers, making it quick to deploy and easy to reset if something breaks.
